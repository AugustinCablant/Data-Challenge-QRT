    "# Optimization for Portfolio Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio Optimisation is the process of selecting the best portfolio, or rather the best set of possible weights for a basket of assets, given some sort of objective function. Common objective functions include maximising returns, minimising risk, maximising return-risk ratio or minimising tail risk. The aim of our study is to understand deeper into how Machine Learning can be used to tackle such a complex asset allocation problem, and potentially devise a quantitative strategy that exceeds traditional methods."

   "source": [
    "The most common strategy that comes to mind when we talk about Portfolio Optimisation would be Markowitz’s Mean-Variance Optimisation. It aims to maximise portfolio returns while minimising portfolio risk, or rather the portfolio’s volatility. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For example, investing in two separate negatively correlated stocks instead of a single stock is likely to reduce the risk, or in this case the volatility, of the portfolio. Such an action can also potentially generate greater returns even with the reduced risk. However, Markowitz’s model requires the forecasted portfolio return and volatility as an input to the model.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Instead of a simple moving average forecast, we see an opportunity to use Machine Learning to gather a more accurate forecast of the future expected portfolio returns and volatility. With the assumption that the underlying theory of Mean-Variance Optimisation works, we would then be able to come up with an optimal portfolio. This strategy would, hence, combine more advanced Machine Learning techniques with traditional financial theory.<br>"
